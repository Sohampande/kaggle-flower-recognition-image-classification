# PROJECT SUMMARY : 

In this project I am making a simple image classification model with PyTorch for the dataset sourced from 
this [site](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition/data). 

Thus, the goal of this project is to build a flower image classifier. As time goes, I will continue to update
this project as much as I can. 

## Some Important Notes : 
- I have not added the dataset here because it takes up a lot of space int the repo. But, by downloading it from the given link above it should be okay.
- I am also not adding the enviornment files here, (ie venv folder). But any changes made to the enviorment, I will be tracking here.

## How to get started : 
- Before you start, you will need to create an python enviornment.
