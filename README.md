# PROJECT SUMMARY : 

In this project I am making a simple image classification model with PyTorch for the dataset sourced from 
this [site](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition/data). 

Thus, the goal of this project is to build a flower image classifier. As time goes, I will continue to update
this project as much as I can.
